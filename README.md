### App for chatting and taking note 

---
### :sparkles: Introduction:

When I was a restaurant manager, every day, I had to talk with many people including employees, partners, vendors, and customers. After that, I needed to remember what happened during the conversation, especially for important things. I was wonder is there any app just for those two simple purposes? So, I decided to make the ChatNote app, which will serve users two main functionalities without wasting time fall on the social media loophole, and still keep them on track of what they want to take note of.
