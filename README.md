# ChatNote App :speech_balloon: :memo: 
### App for chatting and taking note 

### :sparkles: Introduction:
When I was a restaurant manager, everyday, I had to talk with many people including employees, partners, venders and customers.
After that,I needed to remember what happen during the conversation, especially for important things. I was wonder is there any app that just for those two simple purposes?
So, I decided to make ChatNote app, which will serve user two main functionalities without wating time fall in social media loop hole and still skeep them on track of what they want to take note on.
